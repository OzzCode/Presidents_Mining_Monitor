# ✅ Profitability Dashboard Filtering - Implementation Complete!

## Summary

The profitability dashboard has been enhanced with powerful filtering capabilities that allow users to view data based on specific criteria:

### 🔍 **New Filtering Options**

1. **Miner Filter**: Choose between "All Miners" or "Active Miners Only"
2. **Time Period Filter**: View data for "Past 24 Hours", "Past 7 Days", or "Past 30 Days"

---

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. **Backend Changes**

#### **New API Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /api/profitability/active-miners` - Get currently active miners
- ✅ Enhanced `GET /api/profitability/current` - Added `active_only` parameter
- ✅ Enhanced `GET /api/profitability/history` - Added `active_only` parameter

#### **New ProfitabilityEngine Method:**
- ✅ `get_active_miners(hours_threshold=1)` - Identifies miners active within specified timeframe

### 2. **Frontend Changes**

#### **New UI Components:**
- ✅ **Filter Controls Section** - Clean, responsive filter interface
- ✅ **Miner Filter Dropdown** - "All Miners" vs "Active Miners Only"
- ✅ **Time Period Dropdown** - 24h, 7d, 30d options
- ✅ **Filter Indicator** - Shows current filter settings

#### **Enhanced JavaScript:**
- ✅ **Dynamic Data Loading** - Updates based on filter selections
- ✅ **Real-time Filter Updates** - Instant chart and metrics refresh
- ✅ **Filter State Management** - Tracks and displays current filters

## How It Works

### **Filter Options:**

1. **All Miners**: Shows profitability for entire fleet (existing behavior)
2. **Active Miners Only**: Shows profitability only for miners that reported data in the last hour
3. **Time Periods**: Filter historical data by 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days

### **Data Processing:**

#### **Active Miner Detection:**
```python
# Miners active in last 1 hour
active_miners = engine.get_active_miners(hours_threshold=1)

# Only calculate profitability for active miners
if active_only:
    # Filter metrics to active miners only
    # Aggregate data from active miners
    # Calculate fleet profitability for active subset
```

#### **Historical Filtering:**
```python
# Get snapshots only for active miners in time period
snapshots = session.query(ProfitabilitySnapshot).filter(
    and_(
        ProfitabilitySnapshot.timestamp >= cutoff,
        ProfitabilitySnapshot.miner_ip.in_(active_miners)
    )
).all()

# Group by timestamp and aggregate
# Calculate daily profit from filtered data
```

## User Experience

### **Before Enhancement:**
- Only fleet-wide view available
- Fixed 7-day chart period
- No way to focus on currently active miners

### **After Enhancement:**
- **Flexible Filtering**: Choose exactly what data to view
- **Real-time Updates**: Charts and metrics update instantly when filters change
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current filter settings
- **Better Insights**: Focus on active miners for operational decisions

### **Filter Interface:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Miner Filter: [All Miners ▼]  Time Period: [7 Days ▼]   │
│                                                         │
│ Showing: All Miners • Past 7 Days                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## API Usage Examples

### **Get Active Miners:**
```bash
GET /api/profitability/active-miners?hours=1
# Returns: {"ok": true, "count": 5, "active_miners": ["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.101", ...]}
```

### **Get Current Profitability (Active Only):**
```bash
GET /api/profitability/current?active_only=true
# Returns profitability data for active miners only
```

### **Get Historical Data (Active Miners, 24h):**
```bash
GET /api/profitability/history?days=1&active_only=true
# Returns 24h history for active miners only
```

## Benefits

### **For Users:**
1. **🎯 Focused Analysis** - View only relevant, active miner data
2. **📊 Better Insights** - Understand profitability of currently operating equipment
3. **⚡ Quick Decisions** - Filter to time periods that matter for operational decisions
4. **🔍 Troubleshooting** - Isolate issues by focusing on active vs. inactive miners

### **For Operations:**
1. **📈 Performance Monitoring** - Track profitability of currently active fleet
2. **💰 Cost Optimization** - Identify which miners are actually contributing to profitability
3. **🔧 Maintenance Planning** - Focus maintenance on active, profitable equipment
4. **📋 Reporting** - Generate reports for specific time periods and miner sets

## Technical Implementation

### **Active Miner Logic:**
- Miners are considered "active" if they have metrics within the last hour
- Threshold is configurable (`hours_threshold` parameter)
- Only miners with recent hashrate/power data are included

### **Data Aggregation:**
- For active miner filtering, system aggregates data from only active miners
- Historical data is filtered by both time period and miner activity
- Charts automatically update to show filtered data

### **Performance:**
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal data transfer (only relevant time periods)
- Cached results where appropriate

---

## Testing

### **Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Visit profitability dashboard
- [ ] Change miner filter to "Active Miners Only"
- [ ] Verify metrics update to show only active miners
- [ ] Change time period filter
- [ ] Verify chart updates with new time period
- [ ] Test combination filters (Active + 24h)
- [ ] Verify filter indicator shows correct settings

### **API Testing:**
- [ ] Test `/api/profitability/active-miners` endpoint
- [ ] Test filtered current profitability endpoint
- [ ] Test filtered history endpoint

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Consider adding:
- **Individual Miner Selection** - Dropdown to select specific miners
- **Custom Time Ranges** - Date picker for custom time periods
- **Filter Presets** - Save commonly used filter combinations
- **Export Filtered Data** - Download reports for filtered datasets
- **Real-time Updates** - Auto-refresh filtered data

---

## Success! 🎉

Your profitability dashboard now provides powerful filtering capabilities that allow users to:

- **Focus on Active Equipment** - See profitability of currently operating miners
- **Analyze Specific Time Periods** - View data for operational decision-making timeframes
- **Make Better Decisions** - Base decisions on relevant, filtered data
- **Improve Operations** - Optimize based on real-time fleet performance

The enhanced filtering system makes the profitability dashboard a much more powerful tool for mining operation management! 🚀
