## API Endpoints

### Fleet Analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/fleet-summary` - Comprehensive fleet analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/high-risk-miners` - List of high-risk miners
- `GET /api/analytics/maintenance-schedule` - Recommended maintenance tasks

### Individual Miner Analysis
- `GET /api/analytics/miner-risk/<miner_id>` - Risk assessment for specific miner

### BTC Forecasting
- `GET /api/analytics/btc-forecast?days=7` - Bitcoin price forecast

### Fleet Health Trends
- `GET /api/analytics/fleet-health-trend?days=30` - Historical health data

### Model Management
- `POST /api/analytics/train-models` - Trigger model training/retraining
- `GET /api/analytics/model-status` - Check model availability and status

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Initialize Models
The models will be automatically trained on first use, but you can manually trigger training:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/train-models
```

### 3. Access Dashboard
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/dashboard/analytics`

## Model Training

### Automatic Training
- Models are automatically trained when first accessed
- Uses historical data from your mining operations
- Requires at least 30 days of data for optimal performance

### Manual Retraining
```bash
# Retrain all models
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/train-models \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"retrain": true}'
```

### Data Requirements
- **Minimum**: 7 days of miner data
- **Recommended**: 60+ days for failure prediction
- **Optimal**: 180+ days for BTC price forecasting

## Understanding Risk Scores

### Risk Levels
- **LOW (0.0-0.2)**: Normal operation, routine monitoring
- **MEDIUM (0.2-0.5)**: Increased attention, schedule maintenance
- **HIGH (0.5-0.8)**: Priority maintenance required
- **CRITICAL (0.8-1.0)**: Immediate attention needed

### Contributing Factors
- **High Temperature**: >80Â°C sustained operation
- **Poor Efficiency**: Below expected power/hashrate ratio
- **High Rejection Rate**: >3% pool share rejection
- **Unstable Performance**: High hashrate variability

## Maintenance Recommendations

### Automated Scheduling
The system automatically generates maintenance schedules based on:
- Risk assessment levels
- Predicted failure dates
- Historical maintenance patterns
- Operational priorities

### Priority Levels
- **URGENT**: Critical risk miners (immediate action)
- **HIGH**: High risk miners (within 7 days)
- **MEDIUM**: Medium risk miners (within 14 days)

## BTC Price Forecasting

### Forecast Accuracy
- **Short-term (1-3 days)**: Generally reliable for trend direction
- **Medium-term (4-7 days)**: Useful for operational planning
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% statistical confidence bounds

### Use Cases
- **Operational Planning**: Adjust mining intensity based on price trends
- **Maintenance Timing**: Schedule during predicted low-price periods
- **Capacity Planning**: Expansion decisions based on price forecasts

## Performance Optimization

### Model Performance
- Models are stored locally using joblib serialization
- Inference is fast (<100ms per prediction)
- Training occurs in background to avoid blocking operations

### Data Efficiency
- Features are calculated on-demand
- Historical data is cached for performance
- Batch processing for fleet-wide analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No training data available"
- Ensure miners have been logging data for at least 7 days
- Check database connectivity
- Verify miner data collection is working

#### "Model not available"
- Trigger manual model training
- Check for sufficient historical data
- Review error logs for training failures

#### Poor prediction accuracy
- Increase training data duration (60+ days recommended)
- Ensure data quality (no extended outages)
- Consider retraining with retrain=true

### Model Status Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/model-status
```
