### Big-picture ideas
Here’s a pragmatic roadmap of attributes and features that will make your mining monitor more robust, insightful, and maintainable. I split them into data model, reliability, security, performance, UX, analytics/finance, integrations, and DevEx.

---

### Data model and metadata enrichment
Add durable metadata so your UI and alert logic can reason in richer ways:
- Miner inventory fields: `vendor`, `model`, `serial_number`, `firmware_version`, `psu_model`, `mac`, `rack`, `row`, `location`, `room`, `owner`, `notes`.
- Network fields: `hostname`, `mgmt_vlan`, `gateway`, `dns`, `link_speed`.
- Operational baseline: `nominal_ths`, `nominal_efficiency_j_per_th` (from CSV), `power_cap_w`, `fan_mode`, `auto_tune_enabled`.
- Pool info: `pool_url`, `worker_name`, `pool_user`, `region`.
- Cost context: `power_price_usd_per_kwh`, `tariff_plan`, `time_zone`, `carbon_region`.
- Health fields: `board_count`, `alive_boards`, `avg_asic_temp_c`, `heatsink_temp_c`, `fan_count`, `dead_fans`, `last_reboot_at`, `uptime_s`.
- Tagging: free-form `tags` array (e.g., `{"tags": ["testbench", "liquid-cooled"]}`) to allow grouping/filtering.

DB-wise, add a `miners` table (one row per device), continue streaming time-series `metrics` into `metrics` table. Store immutable CSV-derived defaults in `miners.nominal_*` so you can compare measured vs nominal without re-parsing CSV.

---

### Reliability and resiliency
- Timeouts, retries, backoff, and circuit breakers:
  - Per-miner polling timeout (you already have config for CGMiner timeout). Add exponential backoff on repeated failures and a temporary quarantine list for repeated offenders.
  - A circuit breaker to skip polling a miner for N cycles after K consecutive failures.
- Scheduler hardening:
  - Add jitter to job schedules to avoid thundering herds.
  - Separate thread pools for network I/O vs DB writes.
  - Dead-letter queue: persist miner poll errors (`error_events`) with context so failures are inspectable.
- Data quality guards:
  - Reject obviously bad measurements (e.g., `hashrate_ths < 0` or absurd spikes) and mark as `suspect`.
  - Interpolate or carry-forward last good value with a flag when a single sample is missing.
- Redundancy:
  - Optional secondary data sink (e.g., ship metrics to both SQLite and a remote TSDB like InfluxDB/Prometheus) for durability and long-term trending.
- Health endpoints:
  - `/healthz` for basic liveness; `/readyz` ensuring DB and scheduler healthy.

---

### Security and access control
- Authentication for the web UI and API:
  - Session auth for UI, and API keys/JWT for programmatic access. Scope keys to read-only/read-write.
- CSRF protection for any mutating endpoints.
- Least-privilege CORS (restrict origins) and rate limiting on API.
- Security headers: `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `HSTS` (when behind HTTPS).
- Secret management: use environment variables, `.env.sample`, and deny-list real `.env` in VCS.
- Don’t expose miners’ native web UIs outside your LAN; present them through the dashboard with an admin-only link or proxy with ACL.

---

### Performance and scalability
- Async I/O for miner polling (if your `MinerClient` supports it): switch polling pipeline to `asyncio` with `aiohttp`/raw sockets. Keep a bounded semaphore to cap concurrency.
- DB: you already enable WAL. Also add indexes on `(miner_ip, timestamp)` and prune old rows via retention tasks.
- Caching:
  - Cache CSV efficiency and also model lookups per IP for a configurable TTL. You added CSV caching; consider invalidate on file mtime change.
- Batching:
  - Batch inserts of metrics; wrap in a single transaction per polling cycle.
- N+1 avoidance:
  - Your query for latest metrics is good. Consider materialized views/rollups for hourly aggregates.

---

### Observability (logs, metrics, traces)
- Structured logs are in config; add:
  - Request logging with correlation IDs.
  - Miner poll spans and error counts.
- Prometheus exporter:
  - Expose `/metrics` with gauges for `hashrate_ths`, `power_w` (measured vs estimated), `avg_temp_c`, `fan_rpm`, `miner_status{status=...}`. Include labels: `ip`, `model`, `rack`, `location`.
- OpenTelemetry tracing for background jobs and API requests.

Example minimal Prometheus endpoint:
```python
from prometheus_client import generate_latest, CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST, Gauge
from flask import Blueprint, Response

metrics_bp = Blueprint('metrics', __name__)

HASHRATE = Gauge('miner_hashrate_ths', 'Miner TH/s', ['ip','model'])
POWER_EST = Gauge('miner_power_est_w', 'Estimated power in Watts', ['ip','model'])
STATUS = Gauge('miner_status', '1=active,0=stale', ['ip'])

@metrics_bp.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    # populate HASHRATE/POWER_EST/STATUS from your latest snapshot before returning
    return Response(generate_latest(), mimetype=CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST)
```

---

### Alerting and automation
- Alert rules with hysteresis and deduplication:
  - Absolute and relative hashrate drops (e.g., <80% of nominal or -20% from rolling baseline).
  - Over-temp (per-model thresholds) and fan failure detection.
  - Offline detection with graded severity: `Lagging` then `Stale` then `Offline` if > N minutes.
  - Efficiency anomaly: estimated `J/TH` deviates from nominal by X%.
- Multi-channel notifications: Email (in config), plus Slack/Discord/Telegram/SMS (Twilio). Add cooldowns and on-call schedules.
- Runbook links in alerts: a `learn more` link that opens a docs page with remediation steps.
- Optional automation:
  - Soft reboot miner after K mins of no hashrate.
  - Auto power-cap or underclock during peak tariffs.
  - Toggle fan modes when temps exceed threshold.

---

### Financials and analytics
- Profitability panel per miner and aggregate:
  - Daily kWh, cost, revenue, and profit with configurable `power_price_usd_per_kwh` and pool-reported payout metrics.
  - Use CSV nominal TH/s when measured is missing; you already estimate power from J/TH.
- External data feeds:
  - Network difficulty, block reward schedule (halvings), pool API (reported hashrate, stale shares), mempool fees.
- Forecasting:
  - Projected daily/weekly profit, breakeven chart, sensitivity analysis for BTC price and power price.
- Carbon awareness (if you care): show grid CO2 intensity and estimate emissions based on kWh.

---

### Frontend UX enhancements
- Table improvements on Miners page:
  - Column sorting, filtering, quick search, and column chooser.
  - Row highlighting by status/temperature (you already have freshness dots).
  - Per-miner sparkline for hashrate/power over last 24h.
  - Sticky header, responsive layout for mobile.
- Details drawer:
  - Click a miner to open a side panel with last N samples, temps per hashboard, fan RPMs, error logs, and actions (reboot, set pools) if enabled.
- Preferences persistence: UI thresholds (freshness, temp) saved to `localStorage` (you already do some in `overview.js`).
- Theming: you have a theme toggle; add automatic theme based on system preference.

---

### API robustness and contract
- Version your API: `/api/v1/...` and plan for `/api/v2`.
- Filtering and pagination: `/api/v1/miners?status=active&limit=50&cursor=...`.
- Typed schemas with Pydantic/dataclasses and OpenAPI docs (Swagger UI) mounted at `/api/docs`.
- Consistent error envelopes, correlation IDs, and `Retry-After` on throttling.

---

### CSV and configuration robustness
- CSV hot-reload on file modification time change; validate headers and values with error reporting in UI.
- Admin UI: allow editing model overrides (J/TH or nominal TH/s) with a preview and a JSON overrides layer that supersedes CSV.
- Feature flags: enable/disable experimental polling paths.

---

### Testing and quality
- Unit tests:
  - `helpers.utils._normalize_model`, CSV loader, fuzzy matching.
  - Power estimation path in `dashboard.routes.get_miners` with edge cases.
- API tests: shape of `/api/miners` payload, error paths.
- Property tests: random model names and whitespace/symbols to ensure robust normalization.
- Load testing for 100–500 miners (Locust/k6). Ensure scheduler/thread pools and DB keep up.
- Linters/formatters/type checks: `black`, `ruff/flake8`, `isort`, `mypy`.

---

### CI/CD and runtime
- GitHub Actions pipeline: run tests, lint, type-check, and build.
- Containerization: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` with services for app, Prometheus, Grafana, and a volume for SQLite. Provide healthchecks.
- Migrations: add Alembic for database schema changes.
- Backups: periodic SQLite WAL checkpoint and backup job; export to S3/Blob if desired.

---

### Power and environment integrations
- Actual power measurement to validate your estimates:
  - Integrate with smart PDUs (APC, PDUeX) or smart plugs (Shelly/TP-Link) or Modbus meters.
  - Compare measured Watts vs estimated to refine J/TH assumptions automatically.
- Environmental sensors: ambient temperature/humidity sensors per rack; correlate with miner temps and throttling.

---

### Manageability and fleet ops (optional advanced)
- Batch configuration management: set pools, fan profiles, OC/UV profiles across a group of miners with a dry-run.
- Firmware management: show available firmware versions, flag outdated devices, optionally stage/roll firmware (carefully, with approvals and rollback).
- Maintenance mode: temporarily mute alerts for a miner under service.
- Role-based access control (RBAC): viewer/operator/admin roles.

---

### Documentation and runbooks
- `docs/` with:
  - Architecture diagram and dataflow.
  - How to add a new miner model and efficiency override.
  - Alert catalog and remediation steps.
  - On-call checklist and incident playbooks.

---

### Small changes with big wins you can do next
- Add Prometheus `/metrics` and a basic Grafana dashboard.
- Add API versioning and Swagger docs.
- Implement alert deduplication + Slack webhook integration.
- Add miner metadata table and show `location` and `rack` in the Miners list (with sorting and filtering).
- Implement CSV hot-reload with validation and a small admin page to review overrides.

If you want, I can outline a minimal schema for a `miners` table and the API endpoints to manage it, or sketch a Prometheus-ready `/metrics` payload based on your current `get_miners()` output.
