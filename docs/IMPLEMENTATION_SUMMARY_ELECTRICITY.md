## üîÑ Integration Points

### With Profitability Tracking

The electricity system integrates with your existing profitability calculations:

**Before:**
```python
daily_cost_usd = (power_w / 1000) * 24 * DEFAULT_POWER_COST
```

**After (with TOU rates):**
```python
from core.electricity import ElectricityCostService

cost_summary = ElectricityCostService.get_cost_summary(
    session, start_date, end_date, miner_ip=miner.ip
)
daily_cost_usd = cost_summary['total_cost_usd'] / days_in_period
```

This provides:
- ‚úÖ Accurate time-of-use cost calculation
- ‚úÖ Service charge inclusion
- ‚úÖ Demand charge support
- ‚úÖ Real vs. estimated cost comparison

### With Miner Tracking

Cost records can be tracked per-miner or fleet-wide:

```python
# Per-miner cost tracking
cost = ElectricityCostService.record_cost(
    session,
    period_start=start,
    period_end=end,
    power_w=miner_power_w,
    miner_ip=miner.ip,
    location=miner.location
)

# Fleet-wide cost tracking
cost = ElectricityCostService.record_cost(
    session,
    period_start=start,
    period_end=end,
    power_w=total_fleet_power_w,
    miner_ip=None,  # Fleet-wide
    location="Main Facility"
)
```

2. Click "Initialize Default Rates" to create examples
3. Or click "Create New Rate" to configure your own

**Option B - API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/electricity/initialize
```

### 3. View Costs
Check the dashboard for:
- Current active rate
- Cost estimates
- Historical cost summary

---

## üìä Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Flat Rate

**Your Scenario:**
- Electricity cost: $0.12/kWh
- Daily service charge: $0.50
- One miner drawing 3000W

**Configuration:**
```python
# Via API
POST /api/electricity/rates
{
    "name": "My Flat Rate",
    "rate_type": "flat",
    "flat_rate_usd_per_kwh": 0.12,
    "daily_service_charge_usd": 0.50,
    "active": true
}
```

**Daily Cost:**
```python
# 3000W = 3kW
# 24 hours * 3kW = 72 kWh
# 72 kWh * $0.12 = $8.64
# Plus service charge = $0.50
# Total: $9.14/day
```

### Example 2: Time-of-Use Rate

**Your Scenario:**
- Off-Peak (9 PM - 7 AM): $0.08/kWh
- Peak (7 AM - 9 PM): $0.18/kWh
- Same 3000W miner

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "name": "TOU Rate",
    "rate_type": "tou",
    "tou_schedule": [
        {
            "name": "Off-Peak",
            "rate": 0.08,
            "days": [0,1,2,3,4,5,6],
            "start_hour": 21,
            "end_hour": 7
        },
        {
            "name": "Peak",
            "rate": 0.18,
            "days": [0,1,2,3,4,5,6],
            "start_hour": 7,
            "end_hour": 21
        }
    ]
}
```

**Daily Cost:**
```python
# Off-Peak: 10 hours * 3kW * $0.08 = $2.40
# Peak: 14 hours * 3kW * $0.18 = $7.56
# Total: $9.96/day
```

**Potential Savings:** Reduce power during peak hours to save money!

## üîß Configuration Options

### Rate Types

**1. Flat Rate**
- Single $/kWh price, 24/7
- Simplest to configure
- Best for: Residential, simple commercial

**2. Time-of-Use (TOU)**
- Different rates for different times/days
- Supports complex schedules
- Best for: Commercial, industrial

**3. Tiered** *(Planned)*
- Volume-based pricing
- Different rates per consumption tier
- Best for: Large operations

### Additional Charges

**Service Charges**
- Daily connection fees
- Automatically pro-rated for partial days
- Example: $0.50/day = $15/month

**Demand Charges**
- Based on peak power draw
- Charged per kW of peak demand
- Example: $5.00/kW * 100kW peak = $500/month
